## - User Portfolio Watchlist

Every 60 seconds, this plugin curls the Public.com API and saves your watchlist data to your sites WP options table. The fetch interval can be changed, but 60 seconds is the advised period of time to prevent abuse.

**Display your watchlist stocks**

```
[public_portfolio_watchlist]
```

**Exclude specific stocks from your watchlist**

```
[public_portfolio_watchlist hideticker="AMD,GME,LZB"]
```

**Show only specific stocks from your watchlist**

```
[public_portfolio_watchlist ticker="CLNE,SOFI,AMD,AMC,BHAT"]
```

#### **Note:** Special Cases
> If you exclude and include a watchlist stock, it will always default to being hidden. Hiding a stock is the override property. In the shortcode below $HUYA will not be shown.
```
[public_portfolio_watchlist hideticker="HUYA" ticker="HUYA"]
```

## - Basic User Portfolio üë§

Display the basic information from your Public.com portfolio.
```
[public_portfolio_bio]
```

## - Automatic stock referencing

Embed stock references with super simple notation and automatically display self fetching stock tool tips with time chart graphs and other display options. In order to reference a stock in a post or page, just add a '$' before the stock symbol. The stock will be detected automatically.

All referenced stocks will have their data stored automatically in a database table ```PUBLIC_STORED_TICKERS```. You can set the interval in which stock data should be considered stale and a fetch will be made to the Public.com graph API. By default the interval is set at 60 seconds. 
```
The bull case is pretty clear for why $AMD will reach $100.

## - Single Stock Iframes

Embed a single stock chart directly from the Public.com website using a simple shortcode. It's not recomended that this shortcode is used, it seems Public.com has some formatting issues in their embedded iframes. You can alternativley use our custom single stock displays.
```
[public_stock_embed ticker="AMD"]
```
